## Contributing to the Sockethead Project
👍 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 👍<br>
Working together we can make the best collection of tools for ASP.Net Core developers.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## MIT Software License
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License.  
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## What do I do now?
If you've noticed a bug or have an idea about new feature you can open a issue.

Before doing that please go through existing issues (both open and closed) and check if that question already exist so we don't duplicate efforts.
Once the issue is created we will review and decide the next actions.

If that would be something you think you can fix, please suggest your solution!

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. 
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done.  Please limit to one feature at at time.

Always write a clear log message for your commits:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
